# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Anjana.

Welcome to my personal website!  
I work on gravitational waves, pulsars, and data science.

Currently, I work on the NANOGrav Pulsar Timing Array project where I develop methods and perform analyses to search for and detect gravitational wave signals and interesting noise sources in the observational data.
